According to&nbsp;TMZ, an argument started between Quavo and others after the rapper lost a dice game. The debate, which became about who was the better basketball player, continued outside.&nbsp;</p><p>The outlet claims that as Quavo walked away, someone threw a punch, sparking a melee in which at least 10 shots were fired. Takeoff sustained fatal gunshot wounds to the torso and head, the Harris County Medical Examiner’s Office said.&nbsp;</p><h3>Migos were raised by Quavo’s mother, Edna Marshall</h3><p>Quavo (real name Quavious Keyate Marshall) was born on 2nd April 1991 in Athens, Georgia, to Edna Marshall. His father, like Offset’s and TakeOff’s, left when he was young.&nbsp;</p><p>Offset and Takeoff moved into Edna’s house after the family relocated from Athens to Gwinnett County.&nbsp;“We always stayed in the same house. We share everything,”&nbsp;Quavo told&nbsp;Fader. “He’s [Takeoff] basically like my brother.”</p><p>“I don’t look at him [Quavo] as an uncle,”&nbsp;Takeoff said,&nbsp;“but more as my brother.”&nbsp;Quavo told&nbsp;Rolling Stone&nbsp;that Edna didn’t complain about raising three teenage boys:&nbsp;</p><p>“She knew how to raise you as a man. She had a house full of niggas playing games, shoes off, eating all the food, and it’s hard times – but she never complained.”</p><p>Quavo and Takeoff repaid Edna by buying her a house in 2017.&nbsp;“ME and Take Jus Bought Mama A House!!! Tha Big Way!!!,”&nbsp;Quavo tweeted. When the trio moved out, they made the studio their home. Music executive Pierre Thomas told&nbsp;The New York Times:&nbsp;</p><p>“What made me really want to go hard for them is that they packed all their clothes and moved into the studio – literally lived there, sleeping on reclining chairs and making music all day.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqivsRmqK6ZpqTAbrzAq5ynrKNirq24jLKmrmWemrKledOoZKSmn6x8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-irene-columbus-and-how-did-she-die.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Irene Columbus And How Did She Die?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kirby-jenners-parents.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who are Kirby Jenners parents?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./boots-1960s-footwear-hyph-html.html>___ boots (1960s footwear): Hyph.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-knox-promotes-her-new-memoir-with-a-pr-blitz-do-you-believe-her.html>Amanda Knox promotes her new memoir with a PR blitz: do you believe her?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amy-robach-reveals-fears-10-years-after-breast-cancer-diagnosis-is-avoiding-blood-tests.html>Amy Robach reveals ongoing fears 10 years after breast cancer diagnosis as she admits she is avoidin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-bryniarski-movie-actor-net-worth-270381.html>Andrew Bryniarski Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anne-murray-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Anne Murray Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoSync.
