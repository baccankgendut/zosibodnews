"Having a prenup could avoid this acrimony and public attention," says Theresa.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Duke of Westminster's prenup would likely include all of his finances</h2><p id=e7n6JpS1Yf data-wc=27>Miss Olivia Henson may have snapped up Britain's most eligible bachelor, but a prenup would ensure his billionaire wealth would likely remain if they were to separate.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a638ddd9ec8b-bride-and-groom-outing.jpg><p id=e82TMSv1Jz data-wc=36>"Prenups cover everything from property, to debts, income, inheritance, family wealth, heirlooms, and more. If the Westminster's have one, it will likely include that Mr Grosvenor will keep all of his wealth should the couple separate."</p><p id=eyDJke7lwT data-wc=53>Theresa explains that in England and Wales, prenups (and postnups) are not legally binding, but they are persuasive. What this means is that provided that the prenup is drafted in a certain way and is fair, the court is likely to follow the agreement, but the court has complete discretion to overrule it.&nbsp;</p><p id=eMP1k_wPXP data-wc=27>"Prenups are subject to specific requirements to maximise their persuasiveness, and it's likely that the Duke of Westminster was well-informed of these when his agreement was drafted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/b7d366ac41e9-gettyimages-2155773363.jpg><p id=ecF3d5vaJo data-wc=46>"These requirements ensure that the agreement is fair, voluntarily entered into (i.e. there was no pressure from either party), and fully understood by both parties, contributing to its overall persuasiveness. Importantly, it must also not leave one party in a very bad financial position following separation.</p><h2>Is a prenup the most romantic gesture?</h2><p id=ePj1qiBQqA data-wc=37>No newlywed wishes to consider the prospect of separating from their love, but securing a practical and fair future for both parties has been considered to be "one of the most romantic things a couple can do."</p><p id=eZpDH9FF7V data-wc=7>"The agreement must be fair," adds Theresa.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f651bce61523-olivia-henson-smiling.jpg><p id=eu3LGvNabm data-wc=29>"Prenups must be entered into voluntarily, with both the Duke and his wife fully understanding the agreement. A prenup cannot leave one person in a very bad financial position."&nbsp;</p><p id=e51er5YYj0 data-wc=33>If the Westminsters did arrange a prenup it is most likely it was finalised at least 28 days before their wedding. "This time frame is essential to avoid any last-minute stress," says Theresa.&nbsp;</p><p id=eYNV2HkVBn5c data-wc=12><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Eugenie leads best dressed guests at Duke of Westminster's wedding</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eqcRya1kuP data-wc=52>"It also ensures that the court would not infer any pressure, &nbsp;such as that the wedding would not have gone ahead if the prenup was not signed.
