and tweeters” as one of the reasons <a href=#>behind his retirement from the Astros</a> following the team’s playoff run this year.</p><p>The 74-year-old opened up about his stepping down and his opinions <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on “The Steam Room” podcast</a> hosted by TNT personalities Ernie Johnson and Charles Barkley.</p><p>“We had a lot of success here, Ernie and Charles, and then the last couple of months here weren’t very pleasant, because we weren’t 10 games ahead,” said Baker on the podcast.</p><p>He followed that up by arguing that fans should not expect to win it all every season.</p><p>Houston won the World Series in 2022 but lost a 3-2 ALCS lead to the rival Rangers, who went on to win the World Series this year.</p><p>“Every year’s different,” Baker said on the show. “There was a whole bunch of criticism from 30-year-olds and bloggers and tweeters that I’m not doing this and I don’t know that and I told my wife, ‘You know, I’m kind of tired of this and tired of the scrutiny and if I could go manage and show up at say 6:30 for a 7 o’clock game and leave 30 minutes after the game, don’t do the (pregame and postgame interviews), I could manage for another four or five years.’ You know what I mean?</p><p>“After a while, you just get tired of answering questions.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized">Baker talked about his opinions on “The Steam Room” podcast. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>In 2023, Baker and the Astros won their third consecutive American League West division title, finishing with a record of 90-72.</p><p>This did not happen without a strong fight from the Rangers, who battled throughout the entire season and finished with the same record as Houston.</p><p>Through a tiebreaker, the Astros prevailed and won the division.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Baker argued that fans were spoiled following the Astros 2022 World Series win. <span class=credit>Charles Wenzelberg/New York Post</span></figure><p>Baker opened up about tough decisions that he had to face throughout the season, including, “a couple instances, a couple articles, a couple of things that kind of made up my mind late summer.”</p><p>Throughout the season, some pointed out the possible squabbles between him and the front office over game-time decisions, particularly at the catcher position.</p><p>Baker’s preference behind the plate was 13-year veteran Martin Maldonado, compared to rookie Yainer Diaz, who posted a batting average 91 points higher than Maldonado (.282 vs. .191).</p><p>During the season, Baker was also <a href=#>questioned for not playing outfielder Chase McCormick more</a>.</p><p>His .842 was fifth on the team, but he played in just 115 games.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Baker managed five teams across both leagues throughout his tenure. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>“It’s not all about OPS. It’s not all about hitting,” Baker said at the time, per The Athletic. “And I’m a hitter, but this is a total game if you’re going to win, you know what I mean? You want to give yourself as many options and categories to win the game. Now, hitting wins the game, usually. But other areas of the games is what loses you one-run games or don’t-do-this or don’t-do-that. I know everybody wants Chas to play.”</p><p>With that being said, Baker posted a .586 winning percentage during his Astros tenure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpmaWtfqL2wvtOsZp2to6nGbq7ApJyrZaKawaq%2BxJ1km52TlsK0sYyonWaanKS0qLHRrGSappRiwbixxK2cq6tf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./every-upper-rank-demon-demon-slayer-ranked-based-strength.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Every Upper rank demon in Demon Slayer ranked based on strength</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dj-livia-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>DJ Livia Net Worth | Parents</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./boots-1960s-footwear-hyph-html.html>___ boots (1960s footwear): Hyph.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-knox-promotes-her-new-memoir-with-a-pr-blitz-do-you-believe-her.html>Amanda Knox promotes her new memoir with a PR blitz: do you believe her?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amy-robach-reveals-fears-10-years-after-breast-cancer-diagnosis-is-avoiding-blood-tests.html>Amy Robach reveals ongoing fears 10 years after breast cancer diagnosis as she admits she is avoidin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-bryniarski-movie-actor-net-worth-270381.html>Andrew Bryniarski Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anne-murray-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Anne Murray Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoSync.
