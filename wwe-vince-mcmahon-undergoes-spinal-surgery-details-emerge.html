Last year, McMahon stepped down as WWE’s CEO amid an investigation into alleged hush money payments made to former female employees. However, he returned to the company earlier this year and was elected as the Executive Chairman of the Board. McMahon also played a role in facilitating the merger between WWE and UFC’s parent company, Endeavor.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Vince McMahon underwent successful major surgery last week to fix an issue with his spine.</p><p>The procedure lasted over four hours & he is now at home recovering.</p><p>– TMZ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7IqUcN7hyE</a></p><p>— Wrestle Ops (@WrestleOps) <a href=# rel=noopener>July 28, 2023</a></p><p>According to a report from Fightful Select, McMahon’s spinal surgery took place last week and lasted nearly five hours. Sources close to him revealed that it was a “major, life-altering operation.” As a result of the surgery, McMahon was unable to work on RAW and SmackDown. Many superstars were reportedly unaware of McMahon’s surgery until it was publicly disclosed.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Vince McMahon had major spinal surgery last week. We're told he's now recovering. The surgery lasted about five hours and was a pretty intensive one.</p><p>— Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful.com (@SeanRossSapp) <a href=# rel=noopener>July 28, 2023</a></p><p>It remains uncertain how the surgery will impact McMahon’s work moving forward, and Fightful’s inquiries about this matter were not answered. Notably, Triple H was absent from the recent episode of RAW, with Bruce Prichard running the show in his absence. However, Triple H is expected to make his return soon.</p><p>In a separate development, veteran wrestler Dutch Mantell shared insights into the differences in leadership styles between Triple H and Vince McMahon. Mantell praised Triple H for being receptive to ideas from current superstars, while he claimed that McMahon used to react negatively to ideas he didn’t like, sometimes responding with harsh language.</p><p>As WWE SummerSlam approaches, it will be interesting to see how McMahon’s surgery may impact his creative input and involvement in the event. The wrestling community will be closely monitoring any updates regarding McMahon’s recovery and his potential role in the company moving forward</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kxLixjK%2Bgp5uVYrqkucChpqdlpaOxpr7GqJysZaOltq%2Bty2aqrqqXmr%2B6ecOeq5qhnKh6prnEq56eZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zach-tyler-eisen-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Zach Tyler Eisen Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shayna-taylor-dating-ryan-seacrest-wiki-bio.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Shayna Taylor?
