An older son who jumped in to help became lodged in boulders and was rescued by his father, a Massachusetts police officer.</p><p>Melissa Bagley, 44, was part of a family of six from Lynn, Massachusetts, visiting <a href=#>Franconia Falls</a> in the White Mountain National Forest along with a friend Tuesday afternoon, authorities said. The falls are several kilometres off the scenic Kancamagus Highway.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/cft-NdWAEv4LRTIMKz6m_Lf1Bgg=/16x18/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/PUABMAO2LRD2PC4HDFPNYGF2SQ.JPG"><p>A child slipped and fell into a pool and could not escape the fast, circulating current, Sgt. Heidi Murphy, of the state Fish and Game Department, said in a news release. Bagley “jumped into the river to help her child and began to immediately have trouble,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/xiXpb42lJWm-QwB3wbZIsO_Tlh8=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/HIKUN3RESNGN7I27UWJ5HSI4SI.JPG"><p>Two other children jumped in to help their brother and mother. They were able to get the child out of the water, but an 18-year-old brother who was trying to help became lodged in boulders, Murphy said.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>The father searched for Bagley and found her in water below the falls, police said. He began CPR, but she could not be revived, Murphy said.</p><p>The father then made it over to the son trapped by the boulders and pulled him to safety. That son suffered injuries and was taken to a hospital, police said.</p><p>The Everett Police Department identified Lt. Sean Bagley as the husband of Melissa Bagley.</p><p>“While we appreciate all those who have reached out we ask that Lt Bagley and his family be given the time and space to mourn the death of Melissa,” the department said in a statement posted on Facebook.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Franconia Falls is a popular hiking destination and swimming hole in the <a href=#>White Mountain National Forest</a>. People can slide off rock slabs into pools of water, but a website that describes New England waterfalls cautions that people should “take a moment to observe the turbulence in the pool below the falls to help you gauge potential risks.”</p><p>Other people have drowned at the falls, including a 38-year-old man in July 2017, a 17-year-old hiker in August 2015 and a 39-year-old man in October 2003.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmsKeiobFwwNGanp6cqWKutXnFmqSipKlivLbAyKeeZq%2BYmrturdJmpKismJq%2FbrDRqK6nq12pv7q1zaBkraddp7K0r9SeZKynnmSXjKWhfWuIg3R%2FkIuWoIR9b26FeZp2m6SIkGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./anne-hathaway-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Anne Hathaway Net Worth 2024: Film Earnings, Business Ventures, Philanthropy, And More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tilda-swinton-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tilda Swinton Net Worth 2024: Income, Advocacy, Personal Investments and More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./boots-1960s-footwear-hyph-html.html>___ boots (1960s footwear): Hyph.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-knox-promotes-her-new-memoir-with-a-pr-blitz-do-you-believe-her.html>Amanda Knox promotes her new memoir with a PR blitz: do you believe her?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amy-robach-reveals-fears-10-years-after-breast-cancer-diagnosis-is-avoiding-blood-tests.html>Amy Robach reveals ongoing fears 10 years after breast cancer diagnosis as she admits she is avoidin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-bryniarski-movie-actor-net-worth-270381.html>Andrew Bryniarski Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anne-murray-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Anne Murray Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoSync.
