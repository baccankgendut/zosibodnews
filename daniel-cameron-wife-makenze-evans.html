The politician has been married twice and Makenze is his second.</p><p>She is a 2015 Western Kentucky University alumni and is a fifth-grade teacher in Oldham County, Kentucky. On July 31, 2020, the couple exchanged their vows at a small private outdoor ceremony. Following their wedding, the presence of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel on their wedding ignited the rumors that McConnell and Cameron’s wife are related.</p><p>Later, Elizabeth Kuhn, Cameron’s spokeswoman, confirmed that the rumors suggesting a family connection between Cameron’s wife and the senator are “false.” In addition to that, their love and married life have been kept private as of now and therefore, not much is known about how the couple first met.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’m running for Governor because I believe every Kentuckian deserves the opportunity to pave a better path forward for themselves, and for their family.</p><p>Kentuckians are ready for Bold Conservative Leadership.

He previously got married to Elizabeth Cameron in 2016. Their married life only lasted for a year, ending in 2017. However, the reason for their separation has not been disclosed to the media.</p><p>Cameron and Evans share one son.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8%2BepqmklWSxorrInqNmm5GisrO7zWauop6VYrqit8SnsZ5llauur7%2BO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./edson-alvarez-wife.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Edson lvarez Wife, Net Worth, News, Parents, Age, Height</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./clinton-portis-net-worth-2020-2021.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Clinton Portis Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./boots-1960s-footwear-hyph-html.html>___ boots (1960s footwear): Hyph.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-knox-promotes-her-new-memoir-with-a-pr-blitz-do-you-believe-her.html>Amanda Knox promotes her new memoir with a PR blitz: do you believe her?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amy-robach-reveals-fears-10-years-after-breast-cancer-diagnosis-is-avoiding-blood-tests.html>Amy Robach reveals ongoing fears 10 years after breast cancer diagnosis as she admits she is avoidin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-bryniarski-movie-actor-net-worth-270381.html>Andrew Bryniarski Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anne-murray-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Anne Murray Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoSync.
