In the video, Ashley approaches the man in an aggressive manner, questioning him about his driver‚Äôs license and immigration status in the United States.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>In case the police aren‚Äôt helpful. ü´∂üèª I‚Äôm going to bed now. ü•∞ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/5jULKPHGvt</a></p><p>‚Äî Savannah ‚Ä¢ Charlatan, PharmD, IBCLC (she/her) (@rx0rcist) <a href=# rel=noopener>May 18, 2023</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=# rel=noopener>@24hourfitness</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@SanDiegoCounty</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@SanDiegoPD</a> Ashley Barkis needs to be arrested immediately.

Many people demanded that the influencer be apprehended on suspicion of attempted murder.</p><p>Faced with intense criticism, Ashley likely retreated from social media, only to reappear later with an apology video before ultimately deleting her profile once again. Among those condemning her actions was @ellenacuario, a prominent figure in the industry, who strongly criticized Ashley‚Äôs attempt to justify her behavior by mentioning her Filipino heritage.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/jobsbots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ashley-Barkis-Car-Accident-Video.jpg alt="Ashley Barkis Car Accident Video" width=1200 height=672 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Portions of the apology video were shared on Twitter and TikTok by various content creators. In the video, Ashley expressed regret for any disrespect she may have caused the Asian community due to her half Filipino background.</p><p>She specifically apologized to the Asian family depicted in the video for the suffering she inflicted upon them. Ashley emphasized that she does not endorse racism or violence against anyone. However, internet users were quick to point out that her recent actions contradicted her claims just two days prior.</p><h2>What Ashley Barkis say in her apology video?</h2><p>During her apology video, Ashley Barkis sincerely expressed her apologies to the Asian family, acknowledging any pain or distress she may have caused them. She emphasized her strong disapproval of violence and racism towards anyone. However, online users argued that her recent actions contradicted her statements from just two days prior.</p><p>Ashley admitted to displaying agitation and aggression in the TikTok video that had gone viral. She insisted that it did not reflect her true character. At this point, a Twitter user named @rx0rcist claimed that several individuals had reached out to them with evidence of Ashley‚Äôs ongoing racist behavior towards them.</p><p>The influencer went on to explain that the video circulating on social media failed to present the complete story and certain aspects were taken out of context. Ashley clarified that her intention was solely to capture clear images of the other driver‚Äôs license, but encountered difficulties as the Asian driver was not properly presenting it.</p><p>Ashley acknowledged that there were numerous alternative approaches she could have taken to handle the situation without resorting to frustration and violence. She expressed her understanding of this fact and acknowledged her responsibility for not choosing a more appropriate course of action.</p><p>She said towards the end of her apology video:</p><p>‚ÄúI hope you guys understand now that I am not at all racist. I‚Äôm just a human being who needs a little bit more practice.‚Äù</p><p>@rx0rcist pointed out how Ashley did not apologize for almost killing the Asian man when she pushed him in front of the moving traffic. Other users also did not find sincerity in her apology.</p><a title=@ellenacuario href=# rel=noopener>@ellenacuario</a><p>Replying to @taga-ilog ü´£the indignations she got telling people so BOLDLY ‚ú®Now U KNO CAN UNDERSTAND I AM NOT AT ALL RAS‚Ç¨IST‚ú® <a title=itbeyourownpeoplesometimes href=# rel=noopener>#itbeyourownpeoplesometimes</a> <a title=ashleybarkis href=# rel=noopener>#ashleybarkis</a> <a title=filipinopriderevoked href=# rel=noopener>#filipinopriderevoked</a> <a title=californiaroadrage href=# rel=noopener>#californiaroadrage</a> <a title=asianpeopleproblems href=# rel=noopener>#asianpeopleproblems</a></p><p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Your Funny Unni" href=# rel=noopener>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Your Funny Unni</a></p><p>Under TikToker @ellenacuario‚Äôs video, many commenters expressed anger towards Ashley Barkis and suggested that her behavior would have been different if she truly identified as half Filipino.</p><p>Your Funny Unni, in response, shared that her Filipino husband often talks about the challenges his grandparents faced in establishing themselves as legal immigrants in America. She argued that if Ashley Barkis genuinely embraced Filipino culture, she would not have made racist comments towards the Asian family or questioned their legal status in the United States.</p><p>Your Funny Unni sarcastically highlighted Ashley Barkis‚Äô apparent disconnection from Filipino culture and suggested that she had internalized racism that needed to be addressed and rectified.</p><h2>Netizens Demanding her Arrest</h2><p>Ashley Barkis‚Äô Instagram account, where she uploaded her apology video, either got removed or deactivated, resulting in limited viewership. However, a TikTok channel called Your Funny Unni created a video analyzing and discussing Ashley‚Äôs explanation.</p><p>In the video, Your Funny Unni argued that Ashley had forfeited her right to claim pride in her Filipino heritage by questioning the legal status of another Asian individual, despite being a person of color herself and potentially an immigrant in the United States. Users from the Philippines expressed their disassociation from Ashley and their unwillingness to consider her as part of their community.</p><p>Following the cancellation or deletion of her own Instagram account, another account claiming to belong to Ashley emerged. However, internet users speculated that it might be a troll account due to the humorous nature of the post captions, which deviated from a serious tone. At the time of writing, Ashley Barkis has not provided any explanation for the sudden removal of her Instagram account.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51krrS0y56wZpqRp7iqv4ycmKtlkZiwqrDEp6tmrpmZsrB5xqicrGWmnr%2BiuIyiqmarmJp6or7RnqqtnZRirrR50qGcZqqRmLaiuMuyZJqapaiytHnArKCapqNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ashton-kutchers-sister-welcomes-son-before-mila-kunis-gives-birth-2014229.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ashton Kutcher's Sister Welcomes Son Before Mila Kunis Gives Birth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anesongib-biography-net-worth-height-twitter-age-fight-record-real-name-girlfriend-boxrec.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>AnEsonGib Biography: Net Worth, Height, Twitter, Age, Fight Record, Real Name, Girlfriend, Boxrec</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./boots-1960s-footwear-hyph-html.html>___ boots (1960s footwear): Hyph.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-knox-promotes-her-new-memoir-with-a-pr-blitz-do-you-believe-her.html>Amanda Knox promotes her new memoir with a PR blitz: do you believe her?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amy-robach-reveals-fears-10-years-after-breast-cancer-diagnosis-is-avoiding-blood-tests.html>Amy Robach reveals ongoing fears 10 years after breast cancer diagnosis as she admits she is avoidin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-bryniarski-movie-actor-net-worth-270381.html>Andrew Bryniarski Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anne-murray-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Anne Murray Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoSync.
