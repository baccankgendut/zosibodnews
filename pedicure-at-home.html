To help you get started, we spoke <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Jin Soon Choi</a>, an editorial manicurist and founder of the New York City-based JINsoon Spas, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Rita Remark</a>, the global lead educator at essie.

You can also keep a coarse physical exfoliant handy, like a good <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>sugar or salt scrub</a>. And don't forget the lotion to keep your heels and feet moisturized.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-i-prep-my-feet></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Do I Prep My Feet?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You essentially want to follow the same protocol as the salons do, which means you should give yourself at least 45 minutes from start to finish.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Start by removing any old polish with a gentle nail polish remover — I recommend a non-acetone polish remover, as acetone weakens and dries out nail beds," advises Choi. "Fill your tub or basin with warm water and soak your feet in there for five to 10 minutes. To make the experience more spa-like, add in a few drops of your favorite essential oil."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But if you're in a rush, there's a simple hack for saving time. "If you don't have time to soak, you can always give yourself a pedi after a long bath or shower," says Remark.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-i-give-myself-a-salon-quality-pedicure></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Do I Give Myself a Salon-Quality Pedicure?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once your feet have soaked for up to 10 minutes, start by cutting and shaping your toenails. "Keeping toenails short and square prevents infection and ingrown toenails," says Remark. "Soften and refine the shape with a nail file."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Next, it's time to give your toe cuticles a little love. "Using a gentle nail brush, scrub your cuticles and apply a cuticle oil, or olive oil if you don't have," says Choi. "Then, push back your cuticles thoroughly using a cuticle pusher or an orange stick. I try to refrain from cutting cuticles if possible, as they protect your nail bed from bacteria."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Follow up by using a pumice stone or callus remover to gently buff away any hard skin that has formed around the heels and sides of the toes. Then you should be good to go.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"For an extra spa treatment, apply a coarse exfoliant to the feet and massage up the calf," Remark adds. "An exfoliation with a sugar scrub removes excess dead skin, leaving behind <a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>baby-soft feet</a>. Follow with a rinse and lotion."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-i-apply-polish></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Do I Apply Polish?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's essentially the same as applying polish to your fingernails, except you only have to use one hand, which may actually give you a more precise finish. But before you get to painting, make sure to cleanse the toenails one more time using nail polish remover to get rid of any excess lotion or oil, as those will prevent the polish from bonding to the nail.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once you've finished, make sure to have your base coat, polish color, and top coat handy. However, if you want to give your toes a break, that's okay too. "If you are skipping the color, apply a nourishing treatment like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>JINsoon HyperRepair</a>," Choi shares. "This treatment hydrates, strengthens, and restores nail health in just two applications."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you want to go with traditional polish, always start with a base coat. "[It's] a protective layer between your natural nail and polish," Choi continues. "I recommend the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>JINsoon Power Coat</a> base coat, it strengthens and primes the nail with ingredients like biotin and diamond particles for durability."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once your first layer of polish has dried, it's time to add in a little color.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The easiest way to paint your nails is to make sure your first stroke starts from the edge," says Choi. "Utilize the natural shape of the brush to make sure it is as wide as possible. Let your second stripe overlap with the first to cover the rest of the nail. Wait about two minutes until your second coat as you work your way across. Don't forget to paint the tip as well!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Afterward, it's time for one layer of top coat to keep your color looking shiny and fresh. We find that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>essie's Gel Setter Top Coat</a> always does the trick. And if you want to treat yourself to a little something extra, why not? "When nail polish has dried, I recommend applying <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>cuticle oil</a>, like apricot cuticle oil, with a little massage," says Remark.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-i-keep-my-pedicure-looking-fresh-for-as-long-as-possible></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Do I Keep My Pedicure Looking Fresh For as Long as Possible?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"To extend the life of your pedi, make sure you're applying lotion and cuticle oil every night before bed, or before you put your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>socks </a>on in the morning," says Remark. "You can also re-apply top coat every week to restore shine and prolong the wear of your polish."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZL2msMicrKudXZbBbrTOppw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kate-middleton-follow-princess-diana-footsteps-prince-george-sports-day.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Kate Middleton preparing to follow in Princess Diana's footsteps at Prince George's first sports</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-does-julio-urias-make.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Does Julio Urias Make</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./boots-1960s-footwear-hyph-html.html>___ boots (1960s footwear): Hyph.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-knox-promotes-her-new-memoir-with-a-pr-blitz-do-you-believe-her.html>Amanda Knox promotes her new memoir with a PR blitz: do you believe her?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amy-robach-reveals-fears-10-years-after-breast-cancer-diagnosis-is-avoiding-blood-tests.html>Amy Robach reveals ongoing fears 10 years after breast cancer diagnosis as she admits she is avoidin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-bryniarski-movie-actor-net-worth-270381.html>Andrew Bryniarski Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anne-murray-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Anne Murray Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoSync.
