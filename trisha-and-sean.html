If you haven't heard, <a href=#>Trisha Paytas</a> (yes, you know the one) is <a href=#>getting married</a> — and soon. According to a video she posted to her YouTube channel on Oct. 25, a date is set, a ring is on her finger, and she will be married to an unknown suitor before we know it.</p><p>Trisha, while posting entire videos about the engagement and wedding, is keeping a lot of the details very hush-hush. We don't even know who the lucky guy is yet.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Trisha Paytas called her ex, Sean, during a YouTube video to confirm she's getting married.</h2><p>But in a recent video, she confirmed with her ex-boyfriend, Sean van der Wilt, that yes, she is actually getting married.</p><p>In a video posted to YouTube on Oct. 30, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trisha called Sean on camera</a> to tell him about her fiancé. Here's what their conversation revealed about her engagement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">We have more details about her groom-to-be.</h2><p>Trisha opened the video talking about everyone that has contacted her since her engagement announcement went live asking if the engagement is real. Which means that if it is, she told the internet before she told her friends — but that's not really out of character for Trisha.</p><p>And one of the people she needed to tell personally was her ex Sean. Apparently, Sean had previously called her to ask about the engagement, and he was just as surprised as the rest of us.</p><p>"Is this a for-real marriage?" he asks right away. Trisha confirms it is, and he fires back, "Who are you marrying?"</p><p>"You wouldn't know him," she says. "He's an actor... Like a big time actor."</p><p>"That means porn," Sean laughs back — and Trisha doesn't deny it.</p><p>From her conversation with Sean, we now know that she and her new beau only met a month ago, and also that he's a Sagittarius.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>&nbsp;"You’re so f--kng random. I don’t understand," Sean says. "What’s going on? Tell me."</p><p>"I met this person a month ago and then we got engaged and that’s it," Trisha says. "It’s not even that big a deal!"</p><p>Sure it isn't. She says she's not revealing the name of her fiance because she doesn't want to "jinx it," but we're still waiting to see what actually plays out on Nov. 1.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">No, she didn't pick Nov. 1 to shade Shane's new pallet.</h2><p>This was one of the first things she addressed in the video — no, she's not trying to throw any shade at or steal any attention from Shane Dawson. Nov. 1 is the same day <a href=#>Shane and Jeffree Star's new collection</a>, the Conspiracy Collection, is set to launch.&nbsp;</p><p>If you don't know what we're talking about, Shane has been releasing an entire series of videos following the launch of these products, from the conception to the release.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>If you need a refresher, we highly recommend that you watch those videos on his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a>.</p><p>"Shane and Jeffree are Shane Dawson and Jeffree Star," Trisha says in her video. "This pallet will sell out within minutes. This pallet will be way bigger than anything I could possibly do."</p><p>She continued to point out that their announcement of the Conspiracy Collection came after Trisha had already booked the event — which her screenshots confirm.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqb%2Bqv8eaZJqmlGLApq3N</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wesley-pipes-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wesley Pipes Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./trinidad-james-net-worth-2020-2021.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Trinidad James Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./boots-1960s-footwear-hyph-html.html>___ boots (1960s footwear): Hyph.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-knox-promotes-her-new-memoir-with-a-pr-blitz-do-you-believe-her.html>Amanda Knox promotes her new memoir with a PR blitz: do you believe her?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amy-robach-reveals-fears-10-years-after-breast-cancer-diagnosis-is-avoiding-blood-tests.html>Amy Robach reveals ongoing fears 10 years after breast cancer diagnosis as she admits she is avoidin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-bryniarski-movie-actor-net-worth-270381.html>Andrew Bryniarski Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anne-murray-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Anne Murray Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoSync.
