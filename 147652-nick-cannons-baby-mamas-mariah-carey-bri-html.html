It was no different for Nick Cannon and his family as he spent time with his children and baby mamas.</p><p class=fh>Easter season was a joyful one for the <a class="Ed a" href=#>Nick Cannon</a> household. The multi-talented star spent time with his children and their moms on Easter and they all had a great time together.</p><p class=fh>Images of their time together were seen on social media after Mariah Carey and Brittany Bell shared them on their Instagram pages. Brittany Bell, who has a son, Golden Cannon with Nick posted pictures and videos of her and Nick helping Golden to find his Easter eggs.</p><p class=fh>Nick was hilariously dressed like an Easter bunny. Golden also seemed to enjoy his search for the eggs. In one of the videos, he and his mom found one Easter egg on a tree, and when he opened it, he found a green Dinosaur toy inside. He really is a great hunter, isn’t he?</p><p class=fh>Mariah Carey, on the other hand, posted an image showing herself, Nick and their twins posing during their family dinner. Again Nick donned an Easter Bunny hood, while his twins, Monroe and Moroccan Scott looked as adorable as ever.</p><p class=fh>Nick is very good at parenting as it seems and is always there for all of his children, even though he may fail at daddy duties sometimes. The rapper recently <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/nick-cannon-twins-daughter-monroe-dad-fail/>revealed</a> to "PEOPLE" how he was scared one time when his daughter Monroe fell hard from the top of a jungle gym while trying to show him her moves.</p><p class=fh>He explained that she was unhurt from the incident, but he was so scared then, though he tried to act as normal as possible so as not to freak the twins out. Nick Cannon and Mariah Carey divorced in 2016 after about eight years of marriage. They have remained friends since their divorce and always come together to celebrate their twins birthdays and family reunions.</p><p class=fh>The singer once revealed that she never thought she would divorce Nick Cannon, while Nick stills see her as a great person and his “Home Girl.” Nick’s youngest son, Golden Cannon <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://bckonline.com/2019/02/22/nick-cannon-and-brittany-bells-son-golden-turns-two/>turned</a> two in February and daddy was there to celebrate with him, alongside mom, Brittany Bell. Nick Cannon is one definition of the word “Super Dad,” and makes sure he is ever present for all of his children. Thumbs up Nick!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmprcG5lZ3qvtcKkZJyZnqO8r7%2BMm5ibsV2irq6t0makmqqZlrVur8CrnLJlkqe2b7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./patrick-dempsey-asks-14-5-million-for-malibu-home.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Patrick Dempsey Asks $14.5 Million For Malibu Home</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./linda-evangelista-throws-subtle-shade-at-tyra-banks-americas-next-top-model.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Linda Evangelista throws subtle shade at Tyra Banks &amp;amp; Americas Next Top Model</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./boots-1960s-footwear-hyph-html.html>___ boots (1960s footwear): Hyph.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-knox-promotes-her-new-memoir-with-a-pr-blitz-do-you-believe-her.html>Amanda Knox promotes her new memoir with a PR blitz: do you believe her?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amy-robach-reveals-fears-10-years-after-breast-cancer-diagnosis-is-avoiding-blood-tests.html>Amy Robach reveals ongoing fears 10 years after breast cancer diagnosis as she admits she is avoidin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-bryniarski-movie-actor-net-worth-270381.html>Andrew Bryniarski Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anne-murray-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Anne Murray Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoSync.
