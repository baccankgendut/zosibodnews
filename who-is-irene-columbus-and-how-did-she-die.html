Irene reportedly spent some time working in a factory before she began to make cinematic appearances.</p><p>She was married to Alex Michael Columbus, a World War ll Navy Veteran, and a member of the Knights of Columbus. According to other sources, Alex was also an aluminum plant worker and <a href=# rel=noopener>coal miner</a>. He was born on September 10, 1958, and passed away on May 5, 2014.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=She_only_clinched_minor_roles_in_a_few_movies></span><strong>She only clinched minor roles in a few movies</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Irene is said to have worked in a factory before beginning her career in entertainment, as was previously mentioned. Her sole listed filmography consists of her minor roles in Nine Months (1995) and Home Alone (1990). Irene did not star in many films during her time in the entertainment industry, but her son’s career achievements have kept the Columbus family in the public eye.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Her_Son_rose_to_fame_thanks_to_the_holiday_comedy_Home_Alone></span><strong>Her Son rose to fame, thanks to the holiday comedy Home Alone</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Chris Joseph Columbus is an <a href=# rel=noopener>American director</a> and the son of Irene Columbus. He was born in Spangler, Pennsylvania and he studied at the Tisch School of Arts where he notably became interested in making films.</p><p>After penning the scripts for several juvenile comedies in the middle of the 1980s, he made his directorial debut with Adventures in Babysitting (1987), a teen adventure. Soon after, Columbus rose to fame with the hugely popular holiday comedies Home Alone (1990) and Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992).</p><p>Another lucrative film for Columbus was the Robin Williams-starring comedy Mrs. Doubtfire (1993). Moving on, he directed a number of movies throughout the 1990s, most of which received tepid reviews. To date, his highest-grossing movies are Harry Potter and&nbsp;its sequel, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002), as well as The Sorcerer’s Stone (2001). Both movies are adaptations of J. K. Rowling’s books.</p><p>Together with his daughter Eleanor, Columbus co-founded the production firm Maiden Voyage Pictures in 2014. Also, along with ZAG Entertainment and Saban Capital Group, he co-founded ZAG Animation Studios, an animation studio.</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Who Is Sheila Annette Lewis And How Did She Die?</a></strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Irene_Columbus_Died_at_the_age_of_61></span><strong>Irene Columbus&nbsp;Died at the age of 61</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Irene battled cancer till she passed away in 1995 at the age of 61. Chris Columbus’ film Stepmother, which came out a few months after his mother’s demise, was devoted to Irene’s loving memory.

The movie is known by a variety of names to fit international standards, including <a href=# rel=noopener>Stay to My Side</a> (Spanish), My Best Enemy (French), and Side by Side (Portuguese and German).</p><p>Although it is uncredited, Irene’s <a href=# rel=noopener>granddaughter Eleanor</a> Columbus, who is Chris Columbus’ daughter, played the young dancer in the movie.
