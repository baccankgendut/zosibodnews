He added: ”To their credit, I was raised very blissfully unaware of status.”</p><p>His cousin, Nancy Kwan, is a famous Hollywood actress who performed in over 50 films; his great uncle helped invent Tiger Balm; his maternal grandfather, the Rev. Paul Hang Sing Hon, founded a Methodist church; his great-grandfather, Oh Sian Guan, was a founding director of the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation;&nbsp;his paternal grandfather, Sir Arthur Kwan Pah Chien M.D., was an ophthalmologist knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.</p><p>”I was always fascinated by the stories that my grandparents had told me,” Kwan said in an <a href=# rel=noopener>interview.</a> ”And then through my aunt, who also lived in the house – she introduced me to, you know, her world.”</p><p>He moved to Texas with his parents when he was 11.&nbsp;</p><p>He graduated from the University of Houston-Clear Lake with a creative writing degree.</p><p>In 1995, Kevin moved from Houston to Manhattan to attend the Parsons School of Design in Manhattan. ”When I moved to New York in my 20s, at every social event I went to, I found elite New Yorkers name-dropping which school and college they had been to,” Kevin said for <a href=# rel=noopener>Hindustan Times</a> in July 2020. ”Then, they’d want to know where I had gone.”</p><p>In 2000, Kevin established his own creative studio.</p><h2><strong>Crazy Rich Asians</strong></h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-40961 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kevin-Kwan-books.jpg.webp alt="Kevin Kwan books" width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kevin-Kwan-books.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-1 data-svg=1 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-40961 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>In 2013, Kwan released the book ”Crazy Rich Asians.”</p><p>Kevin said the novel was loosely based on his own childhood in Singapore. ”This book really is, in many ways, inspired by my childhood,” Kwan&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>revealed</a>.
