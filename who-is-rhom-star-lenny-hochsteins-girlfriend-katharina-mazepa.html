The plastic surgeon clarified that he didn’t initially want to address the ups and downs with his estranged wife.</p><p>“Lisa and I are getting divorced. A few weeks ago I denied this because I am trying my best to protect my family during this process,” he added. The former couple, who wed in October 2009, <a href=#>share two kids: Logan, 6, and Elle, 2.</a></p><p>The Canada native for her part, also <a href=#>weighed in on the major life change</a>, telling Us that same day, “With two young children involved, as a mom I’m going to focus all of my energy and time on them. I’m blindsided by his behavior and reckless handling of the situation.”</p><p>Viewers have watched Lisa and Lenny’s <a href=#>relationship unfold on screen after they joined RHOM in season 2</a>. Their fertility struggles were a large story line <a href=#>before they welcomed their children via surrogate</a>. Lisa later revealed that their marriage almost ended due to a brief separation that resulted in Lenny having an “emotional” affair.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“A lot of people had a lot of questions about where we are in our marriage and a lot of the issues were from so long ago, like, eight years ago. So they really aren’t issues in our life right now, but I had to address it because people wanted to know. And I signed up for a reality TV show,” Lisa explained to Us in March, <a href=#>months after the RHOM reboot aired on Peacock</a>. “It definitely opened up the old wounds. It’s not something I wanted to talk about, but I knew it was a topic that would come up because some people knew about it. I wanted to talk about it on my terms before somebody kind of, like, just asked me about it in a scene or in a group setting.”</p><p>Scroll down for everything to know about Mazepa amid her romance with Lenny:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkxKm7jKKqZqqYpLpuv9OaqWaklaO7unnHqJqhq6Satq%2B%2FjKCgq6SWp7amusNmopqsmJa%2FqrrAZqSaspWlrnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./adam-beason.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Screenwriter &amp;amp; Producer Adam Beason?
