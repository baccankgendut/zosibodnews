they rake in.</p><p>One woman, Paris Taylor, has described the role of traffic controller as the “worst job ever”.</p><p>“For everyone hyping traffic control as a good job, why are you lying?” she said in a TikTok video.</p><p>When she was asked about the pay, she said the reality was it “only pays well if you are doing long hours”.</p><p>Other women have described dealing with nightmare pedestrians and drivers.</p><p>Nursing student Unity Adams filmed a TikTok video on a worksite outlining what women cop on a regular basis.</p><p>“Getting ‘cat called’ every 20 minutes,” she said, adding she was hit on 24/7.</p><p>Perth-based traffic controller Amelia Brady also confirmed that she is “hit on” by drivers all the time.</p><p>Ms Adams added she also has to endure “angry men” yelling at her to get off the road and having to listen to other tradies constantly talking about other women.</p><p>But she was quick to add that her complaints weren’t about male colleagues or anyone she works with but is about the “public pedestrians that walk by”.</p><p>Another Aussie lollipop lady Chloe Taouk previously revealed she earns almost <a class=body-link href=#

around Sydney, she outlined that by working almost 58 hours in six days, she raked in a whopping $2949, although it’s not clear whether this is her earnings before or after tax.</p><p>For one shift on Thursday she worked just 15 minutes, scoring herself $148, while Sunday was the most lucrative with $717.40 in the bank for 12.5 hours due to double time.</p><p>Her longest shift was 14 hours on a Wednesday, which netted her $611.50, while a higher rate on Saturday gave her $557 for nine hours.</p><p>During the week, she worked for 12 hours on the Monday raking in $496, while her 10-hour shift on Tuesday scored her $409.45.</p><p>Overall, her pay packet equated to an incredible $50 an hour for her working week.</p><p>But a Melbourne traffic controller recently took social media to complain about making $2000 every week because of a <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=6b02c11483995a9c27155f6b6c7110ee data-tgev-label=finance data-tgev-metric=ev>hidden cost to the job</a>.</p><p>Maria Kefalas, 21, said on TikTok she almost immediately applied for the job after hearing about the lucrative role.</p><p>‘I’ve been seeing a lot of TikTok (videos) in regards to traffic control, and they are all positive,’ she ranted in her post.</p><p>She joked to viewers that she thought she was going to be “so rich”.</p><p>But she said this was “false hope” because “it has got to be the most inconsistent job I have ever done in my life”.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“What people don’t tell you is you can work that whole week from Monday to Friday and get that much money [$3000] but then you could … have a whole month with no work,” she explained.</p><p>The award rate nationally for a traffic controller is $29.79 per hour but it can jump to $99.15 per hour if working overtime.</p><p>According Seek, the median annual salary in NSW for a traffic controller is $76,249.</p><p class=postsid
