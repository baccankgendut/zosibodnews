Authoritative sources have estimated that Ronaldo’s net worth is as high as $420 million, accumulated during his career in top flight soccer which began in 2002 . This may well increase as Christiano’s current salary and income from playing and sponsorship deals is now close to $60 million every year, with Forbes ranking him “the world’s highest-paid athlete” in 2016 and 2017.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=cristiano-ronaldo-net-worth-420-million></span>Cristiano Ronaldo Net Worth $420 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Christiano was raised in a relatively poor home – during his school years he was popular among the other kids in class, however, his behaviour definitely couldn’t be described as great, in fsct he was actually expelled from school after he threw a chair at his teacher. Anyway, this incident didn’t have a big influence on Ronaldo’s future net worth and career, as from the age of 14, with the support of his mother, they decided to concentrate on football, as he had been an outstanding player since he was eight years old.</p><p>His football career, and the first steps to the successful raising of CR7’s net worth, began seriously when he was linked to the famous Sporting Club de Portugal. This contract laid a firm base to Christiano’s net worth, and led him to think about his future career as a football player. However, at the age of 15 Ronaldo had some serious problems with his heart, and this factor could even have closed the door to such a career for him, but after successful surgery, Christiano was able to continue playing.</p><p>The really great investment to the net worth of&nbsp; Christiano Ronaldo was made in 2003, when he signed a contract with a club known worldwide – Manchester United of the English Premier League. For the two seasons Ronaldo had been going to play, he was given almost $13 million, then at the conclusion of this of this contract, Christiano re-signed with Manchester United, and from 2007 was receiving $120,000 per week, and that’s how CR7 became the highest paid soccer player in the club. In the six seasons he eventually played for United, he played in 292 games in all competitions, scored 118 goals and was a part of the club winning nine trophies. In 2008 Ronaldo became the captain of the team after the great ending to the 2007 season when Untied won the European Cup.</p><p>However, at the end of the 2008-09 season, Ronaldo decided to leave Manchester&nbsp; and play for Real Madrid, at a then world record transfer fee of $120 million, and until today Christiano has stayed with this team, reputedly on a salary of $25 million per year. He has so far played in 396 games in all competitions, and scored 418 goals, of course setting several other records along the way, including helping the team win three European Champions League titles, reaching 400 goals for Real and 600 career goals, including over 100 in European club competition, the only player to do so.</p><p>Internationally, he has played 144 times for his country, scoring 78 goals, and was a member of the team which won the European Championship in 2016.</p><p>In his personal life, Christiano is the father of three sons, including twins, but refuses to reveal the identity of their mother(s). His girlfriend is Georgina Rodriguez, but so far – that’s it! He is currently based in Madrid.</p><p>Christiano is a well-known philanthropist, both for individuals and on a larger scale, including after the tsunami that his Aceh, Indonesia, and contributing to medical relief associated with the ebola crisis in West Africa Ebola.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Cristiano Ronaldo</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$420 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$60 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 5, 1985</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Santo António, Portugal</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft (1.85 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>176 lbs (80 kg)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Football player, Fashion entrepreneur</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Portugal</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Cristiano Ronaldo Jr.</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro, José Dinis Aveiro</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Hugo, Elma, Liliana Cátia</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>The Sultan Of The Stepover , CR7 , Rocket Ronaldo , C.
