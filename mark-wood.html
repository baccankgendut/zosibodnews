With the win over New Zealand, England had qualified for the semi-final stage of the tournament for the first time since 1992. This was also<br>the first time since 1983 that England had beaten New Zealand in the tournament.</li><li>In the final of the tournament, also against New Zealand, he was run out on the last ball of the match to leave the scores tied. This meant that the match had to be decided via a tie-breaking ‘super over’ which, in bizarre circumstances, also ended up getting tied. England was then declared the victor based on a highly controversial ‘boundary countback’ rule.</li><li>Mark was one of the stars of England’s title-winning campaign as he was the joint 5th-highest wicket-taker in the tournament with 18 scalps to his name.</li><li>He had sustained a side injury during that final match which had ruled him out of the first three test matches of the 2019 Ashes series which had started within a month of that match.</li><p>Featured Image by Mark Wood / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqaYq6NdrLywsI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mary-beth-mcdade-net-worth-income-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mary Beth McDade Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./madden-24-solo-battle-rewards-and-not-working-fix.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Madden 24 Solo Battle Rewards And Not Working Fix</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./boots-1960s-footwear-hyph-html.html>___ boots (1960s footwear): Hyph.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-knox-promotes-her-new-memoir-with-a-pr-blitz-do-you-believe-her.html>Amanda Knox promotes her new memoir with a PR blitz: do you believe her?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amy-robach-reveals-fears-10-years-after-breast-cancer-diagnosis-is-avoiding-blood-tests.html>Amy Robach reveals ongoing fears 10 years after breast cancer diagnosis as she admits she is avoidin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-bryniarski-movie-actor-net-worth-270381.html>Andrew Bryniarski Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anne-murray-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Anne Murray Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoSync.
