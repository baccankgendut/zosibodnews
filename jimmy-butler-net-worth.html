During his career to date Jimmy Butler has played for teams such as the Chicago Bulls and the Miami Heat. Originally drafted in 2011 after a few years of college basketball, Butler quickly earned the nickname "Jimmy Buckets." He is a five-time NBA All-Star, a four-time All-NBA Team honoree, and a five-time All-Defensive Team honoree. In addition, he won the NBA Most Improved Player award in 2015.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Jimmy Butler III was born on September 14th of 1989 in Houston, Texas. Abandoned as an infant by his father, Jimmy Butler found himself on the street by the age of 13. His mother had kicked him out of the home, and he stayed with various friends over the next few years. Many years later, Butler revealed that he remains close with his parents despite the fact that they both abandoned him at an early age.</p><p>During his high school years, Jimmy's basketball talents were quickly spotted. He was then accepted into the family of Jordan Leslie, a future NFL star who was enrolled at the same school. By the time Butler had reached his senior year, he was averaging 19.9 points per game. Despite his strong performances, he was not heavily recruited by colleges when he graduated from high school.</p><p>He first played a single season at Tyler Junior College, and his talents soon became more widely known. Jimmy then played college basketball for a single year with Marquette, which had offered him an athletic scholarship. His statistics improved significantly within the next few years, and he eventually achieved an average of 15.7 points per game by his senior year.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>In 2011, Butler left college and declared himself eligible for the NBA Draft. He was selected by the Chicago Bulls as the 30th overall pick. Unfortunately, his career got off to a slow start, as Jimmy found himself on the sidelines throughout most of his rookie year. In addition, the season was shortened due to a lockout. Next season, things improved drastically for Jimmy, and he played all 82 games for Chicago. Although the following season started slowly for him, he eventually saw more playing time and scored 28 points against the Raptors. During the 2013-2014 season, Butler missed 15 games due to injury, although he saw more minutes per game than ever before. By the end of the season, he was named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team.</p><p>In the 2014-2015 season, he scored 32 points against the Denver Nuggets. He then broke this record with 35 points against the New York Knicks. Another injury followed, although Butler recovered and played well throughout the playoffs. He ended the season by winning the NBA Most Improved Player award. This was the first time any Bulls player had won the award.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-152879 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Jimmy-Butler.jpg alt="Jimmy Butler Net Worth" width=900 height=613 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-152879 class=wp-caption-text>Christian Petersen/Getty Images</p><p>Before the next season, Jimmy signed a new five-year, $95-million contract. His performances continued to improve, and he eventually scored 43 points in a game against the Detroit Pistons that season. He then scored 40 points in a single half against the Toronto Raptors, breaking <a href=#>Michael Jordan's</a> record in the process. The season continued, and Jimmy Buckets scored 53 points in a game against the Philadelphia 76ers. Unfortunately, he then suffered a knee injury that put him on the sidelines for a month. This injury would continue to trouble him for the rest of the season.</p><p>Butler spent one more season with the Bulls before being traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves. More injuries followed, and he underwent surgery on his right knee. After one season, Jimmy requested a trade, and he was passed to the Philadelphia 76ers. He then spent a single season with this team before signing with the Miami Heat in 2019.</p><h2 id=salary-contracts><strong>Salary and Contracts</strong></h2><p>In his first 10 years in the NBA alone, Jimmy earned $140 million in NBA salary. He earned tens of millions more from endorsements. In July 2019 he signed a 4-year $140 million contract. This contract brought Jimmy's annual NBA base salary up to $32 million.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 2017, Butler sold his home in the Chicago neighborhood of River North. He sold the residence for $4.2 million, which was well below the initial listing price of $5 million. He first cut the price to $4.6 million before finally settling on a selling price of $4.2 million. This represented a net loss, as Butler had originally purchased the home for $4.3 million in 2015. The residence spans 10,000 square feet of living space and includes six bedrooms. Additional features include a 750-bottle wine cellar, a roof deck, a home theater, a game room, and a three-car garage.</p><p>In 2018, it was reported that Butler had made a number of real estate transactions. He first purchased two condos in a newly-built River North building. Both of these condos were purchased for over $1 million. Immediately, Jimmy listed one of the two condos for $1.45 million. This residence was purchased for $1.239 million, is situated on the fifth floor, and features three bedrooms. It also spans 1,663 square feet of living space. Additional features include a private elevator entrance and hardwood floors.&nbsp; The second condo was purchased for just under $2 million, and Jimmy reportedly intended to keep this unit for himself.</p><p>In 2019, Jimmy Butler put his home in Pennsylvania on the real estate market. This residence was listed for $6.8 million and is located in Ambler. Originally built in 1913, the home sits on 7.8 acres of land. It features 14,000 square feet of living space and six bedrooms. Additional highlights include a wine cellar and a home theater.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNku6OtjqOgpqWpYq%2B2wMueqWamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jimmy-fallon-surprised-by-seth-rogen-james-franco-for-birthday-video-2014209.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jimmy Fallon Surprised By Seth Rogen, James Franco For Birthday: Video</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jill-latiano-pets.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Jill Latiano Pets - Celebrity Pets</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./boots-1960s-footwear-hyph-html.html>___ boots (1960s footwear): Hyph.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-knox-promotes-her-new-memoir-with-a-pr-blitz-do-you-believe-her.html>Amanda Knox promotes her new memoir with a PR blitz: do you believe her?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amy-robach-reveals-fears-10-years-after-breast-cancer-diagnosis-is-avoiding-blood-tests.html>Amy Robach reveals ongoing fears 10 years after breast cancer diagnosis as she admits she is avoidin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-bryniarski-movie-actor-net-worth-270381.html>Andrew Bryniarski Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anne-murray-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Anne Murray Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoSync.
