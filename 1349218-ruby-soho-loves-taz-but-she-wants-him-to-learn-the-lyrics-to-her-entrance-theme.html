When asked about her thoughts about Taz singing her theme on commentary, Soho said she loves Taz but wishes he knew the words to the song.</p><p>“I love Taz so much, and that is such a constant,” Ruby Soho said. “I think it’s become something that people are like almost upset about when it doesn’t happen when he’s not on commentary for some reason somebody’s like, ‘We need Taz to sing Ruby’s theme music!’</p><p>“The only thing is one day, I don’t know when it’s gonna be, it could be on Elevation or Dark or whatever, but I’m just gonna come straight to the commentary table and put down the lyrics in front of him. These are the words to the song! It’s pretty much the same. It’s my name over and over and over again.</p><p>“But somehow, he almost never gets it right. Never ever, ever. I love him to death. But it’s like Taz just read them! Read the lyrics. You can sing it as much as you want. Just get the words right. No, he’s the best. He’s added a little bit to the entrance music that I think people follow along with, so it’s pretty great.”</p><p>When asked if she believed the entrance music would be as over with the audience as it is, Soho admitted she knew how much she loved the theme but was not in any way prepared for the reaction from the All Elite Wrestling fanbase.</p><p>“So I knew how much I loved that song. I knew how excited I was to use that song. I was not even remotely close to prepared a few months leading into it,” Ruby Soho said. “After I’d done Lars’ podcast [I had no idea] that it was just going to essentially change my life.</p><p>“Using the song and using the name and everything and being so overwhelmingly grateful to the band itself for allowing me to use probably one of their most popular songs that they’ve ever come out with. So I knew how catchy it was to me. But I wasn’t sure how it was going to be perceived to the crowd.</p><p>“I had obviously done the vignettes prior to arriving at AEW. And I think that song really just pulled it all together. Like I wanted to show kind of my journey along from being released until I got to AEW. And I think it really just brought it all together, and it really just put that exclamation point that it needed for me to arrive at AEW.</p><p>“And then now that the fans are really starting to get the words a little bit better than Taz, it’s really becoming something that I just look forward to every week. I look forward to every time I go out there to be able to sing with them. So it’s really just made my career and my journey so much better.”</p><p><a href=#>Ruby Soho On Women Bleeding In Wrestling: If You’ve Got A Problem With It, Don’t Watch It</a></p><p>What do you make of Ruby Soho’s comments?
