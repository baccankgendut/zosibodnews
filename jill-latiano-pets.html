I used to — I used to like cats, because, I don’t know, I just thought it was kinda cool that cats were so standoffish and you had to kind of seduce a cat. You know, cat’s not just gonna come to you. You have to kind of like play games with the cat. I thought that was kinda sexy and fun. But with dogs — I mean, I always thought, with dogs, I’m like, “Too easy. It’s too easy.” They run up to you, they slobber all over you, lick you, jump on you. You know, like, “Get your dirty paws off me. You’re a little desperate.” You know what I mean?</p>Glenn Howerton, Late Night with Seth Meyers, Sept 2021 <a href=# class=cpw_fancybox><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Glenn-Howerton-Calico-Cat-195x195.jpg alt="Jill Latiano's pet Calico Cat" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 250px,195px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h3 class=single__pet-summary__name>Calico Cat (Cat)</h3><span class=single__pet-summary__meta><span class=single__pet-summary__type>Breed: Calico</span></span><p>A rare photo of Cat Daddy Glenn Howerton and one of his previous kitties. This photo was shared by his wife Jill Latiano on Instagram. Howerton is seen here with a pretty Calico cat and one of his newborns. Judging by the potato-quality photo, we’d guess this was taken in 2011 when their first son Miles was born. But it could be from 2014 when their second son Isley was born.</p><h2 class=single__celeb-profile__title>Jill Latiano</h2><a href=# class=cpw_fancybox><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Jill-Latiano-Howerton-Pets-250x250.jpg alt="Jill Latiano Pets" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h4>Birthday</h4><p>September 17, 1980 (43)</p><p>Jill Latiano Howerton is an American actress, model, dancer, and media personality who is best known for her work in television.
