If I was around pets, dairy, or dust, I'd have an asthma attack.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;I played basketball in high school. My high school team was the No. 14 team in the country and won four state titles in Florida.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;I was a ghostwriter in the industry for three years before making it as an artist. I still write songs for other artists today.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;I was BMI's co-songwriter of the year for 2010 alongside <strong>Lady Gaga</strong>, for writing the most top songs in 2010.</p><p><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;I went to college for musical theater in New York City.</p><p><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;I'm attracted to polite women, but like bad girls too.</p><p><strong>7.&nbsp;</strong>My middle name is Joel, which is also the first name of my father and older brother.</p><p><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;I'm the youngest of three children, so I was always spoiled a little bit more.</p><p><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;When<span>&nbsp;I'm in a relationship, I write songs for and sing to the person I'm with.</span></p><p><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;I kept to myself in school and wasn't interested in going to homecoming, prom, or attending most school social functions. People may have thought I was obsessed with myself, but really, I was obsessed with honing my craft.</p><p><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;I think most celebrities are jerks. Get that chip off your shoulder!</p><p><span><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;</span>I love&nbsp;Olive Garden, especially the Alfredo sauce. But, when I went Italy, they didn't even know what Alfredo sauce was. Shocking!</p><p><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;I wish I knew how to cook. Every dinner attempt has ended in a disaster.</p><p><strong>14.&nbsp;</strong>I fell in love in Australia.</p><p><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;I'm a very sexual person.</p><p><strong>16.&nbsp;</strong>I had a grapefruit tree in my backyard growing up so grapefruit was always an ingredient for every meal. I no longer like grapefruit.</p><p><strong>17.&nbsp;</strong>I've never broken a bone.</p><p><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;I used to eat four bananas per day when I was in college in New York because they were 25 cents a piece and I was a baller on a budget. People would ask why I ate so many bananas and I would say, 'I'm on this new potassium diet.'</p><p><strong>19.</strong> I've given every plaque or award I've won to my mother.</p><p><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;I was chubby for a few years of my childhood and was insecure about taking my shirt off at the pool, so I wore a T-shirt in the pool. Now, I rip my shirt off at every show.</p><p><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;I'm not into drugs, but I love a social drink. My preferred beverage is a Mojito, but I usually drink Vodka and water because it prevents a hangover and is not as bad for the six-pack.</p><p><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;I sleep about four hours per night and I cannot wake myself up. Someone has to wake me up by either banging on my door or physically shaking me.</p><p><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;Once I find a meal that like, I'll eat it every day for months. The meal becomes a part of my routine until someone forces me to try something else.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>24.</strong>&nbsp;My father and my mother are still married today. I come from a loving, middle-class family.</p><p><strong>25.</strong>&nbsp;I dated my childhood sweetheart all through high school, and thought for sure I would marry her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOa2xmrJieu6i%2FjLKmrmWUpLu1ecqnprBlkZe8tsCMppxmopGovK95w56prqSfYn9xfZBrbnI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alisha-newton-heartland.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alisha Newton: Early Life, Movies, Boyfriend &amp;amp; Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./christine-quinn-selling-sunset-age.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How old is Christine Quinn?
