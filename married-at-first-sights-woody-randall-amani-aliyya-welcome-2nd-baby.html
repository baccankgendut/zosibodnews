The new baby was born weighing 6 pounds and measuring 19 inches. On her Instagram Story, Aliyya shared that her son’s name translates to “guardian manifestor.”</p><p>“We are super excited to have completed our family! We’ve been resting and enjoying our new family of 4 dynamic,” the couple told Us Weekly in a statement. “Reign is totally obsessed with his baby brother! He gives Rai lots of hugs and kisses. He even tries to feed him his snacks. The moment Reign woke up Tuesday morning and met Rai was so sweet. He smiled really big and wanted to play with him. We can’t wait to watch their relationship continue to grow!”</p><p>Aliyya, 32, told <a href=# rel=noopener>MunaMommy</a> that as with their first son, Reign, she opted for an intimate home birth at the family’s New Orleans house. Randall, 33, said he was able to be more involved in the birth this time around.</p><p>“I’m feeling good about the birthing process because I was able to be more hands-on than with Reign,” Randall told the outlet. “I feel like that experience makes Rai and [my] bond that more impactful. I feel like my connection with Amani was deepened also because I was able to assist and be more helpful.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Married-at-First-Sight-Stars-Woody-Randall-and-Amani-Aliyya-Welcome-Baby-Number-Two-02.jpg><p>The couple tied the knot in 2020 on season 11 of Married at First Sight and <a href=#>welcomed their first child</a>, son Reign, in June 2022. “It’s still pretty early, but we think he may look more like Woody, and he may have Woody’s eyes,” Aliyya told Us shortly after Reign’s birth. “I think he has my nose.”</p><p>“I’m very excited for Father’s Day,” Randall added. “I’m looking forward to taking all the cheesy pictures with my baby and wearing matching outfits.”</p><p>As she neared the end of her pregnancy with Reign, Aliyya said that she wasn’t afraid of how her life would change after she became a mother. “It’s the women who comment that my life is about to end once I have my baby that really make me think about societal standards today,” she captioned her maternity shoot photos in March 2022.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She continued: “Yes, my life will change, but … I don’t have to ‘live it up’ now because I’m having a baby. I will of course have to make sacrifices, but my life is about to open a new chapter of living.”</p><p>Married at First Sight airs on Lifetime Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGammaKntqawjJqrZp6Zp8C1edKinqGso2LEsLvDsmSrmZ6Zrq24jJqkmqaZYq6ttdiymGavlaGwsLnEZmmnnF2XrqPFjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-heverly.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Heverly</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kiera-chaplin-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kiera Chaplin Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./boots-1960s-footwear-hyph-html.html>___ boots (1960s footwear): Hyph.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-knox-promotes-her-new-memoir-with-a-pr-blitz-do-you-believe-her.html>Amanda Knox promotes her new memoir with a PR blitz: do you believe her?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amy-robach-reveals-fears-10-years-after-breast-cancer-diagnosis-is-avoiding-blood-tests.html>Amy Robach reveals ongoing fears 10 years after breast cancer diagnosis as she admits she is avoidin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-bryniarski-movie-actor-net-worth-270381.html>Andrew Bryniarski Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anne-murray-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Anne Murray Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoSync.
