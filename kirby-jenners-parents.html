These included nominations in 2016 for Best Photography & Graphics and a 2018 nomination for the best Meme/Parody account.</p><h3><strong>Is Kirby only famous because of the Jenner-Kardashian association?</strong></h3><p>No, he was already a pretty successful amateur model before any of this even took place.</p><p>He is also quite a well-respected comic, having found regular work and relative fame within the comedy scene before he got involved with the Kardashians.</p><p>This probably helps to explain how an otherwise normal person has managed to find himself in with one of the most powerful families in all of the American media.</p><p>With well over one million followers, though, it is pretty clear that he has managed to use his creativity to elevate himself and bring in even more attention for himself.</p><p>What is interesting about Jenner is that he has never really broken away from his character.</p><p>Precious little is known about his real identity or his family.</p><p>For example, we have no idea who the parents of Kirby Jenner are.</p><p>Given he never leaves his identity as Kendall’s twin, to his ‘personality,’ he is simply another one of the Jenner family.</p><p>Even during interviews, he has never broken away from the persona and character that has helped to elevate him to the peak of his fame.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Daniel Naroditsky Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>Who are Kirby Jenner’s parents?</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-66550 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/kirby-jenner-real-parents.jpg.webp alt="kirby jenner real parents" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/kirby-jenner-real-parents.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-2 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-66550 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>If you were to ask him, he would tell you that his parents are Kris Kardashian and Caitlyn Jenner.</p><p>He claims to be the youngest of the Jenner children, and that he has four older sisters and half-sisters.</p><p>Of course, this is all just a media play – part of the ‘gag’ – in terms of his real parentage.</p><p>Nobody knows.</p><p>Jenner has done a pretty fantastic job of basically hiding his entire personal life outside of his persona.</p><p>Most people who have been around for as long as he has eventually found themselves having to break character.</p><p>Or, the character runs tired, and they need to find another way to get people to pay attention to them.</p><p>For Jenner, so far, though, this has not been an issue whatsoever.</p><p>His ‘real’ name is believed to be Dante Palminteri.</p><p>His character is believed to have been conceptualized by YouTube personality Josh Ostrovsky.</p><p>Some also believe that ‘Jenner’ might be the son of another Hollywood star in the form of Chazz Palminteri.</p><p>That might explain, then, how he has essentially managed to work his way into one of the most prominent families within celebrity culture.</p><p>The strangeness of the whole experience can be hard for people to believe – that someone has essentially become famous because they have worked their way into the Kardashian-Jenner industry.</p><p>It is hard to know for sure what any of this really means, other than it seems being out there and outside the box with your thinking can produce some pretty interesting results.</p><p>Given there are no brothers within the family, this whole thing comes as quite an odd social media gig.</p><p>This is the world we live in, though, and it has clearly worked out pretty well for Kirby – or Dante, whatever you want to call him!</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong> <a href=#>Who is Jennifer Todryk’s husband</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfoLazrthmoZ6mnpq%2FtHnPmqmepqSofA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-are-quavos-parents-all-you-need-to-know.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who are Quavos parents?
