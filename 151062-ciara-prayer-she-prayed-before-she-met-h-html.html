Ciara is a single mother having had a son, Zahir Future, with rapper Future.</p><p class=dh>"I prayed for a God-fearing man. I prayed for discernment. I prayed for wisdom to learn from the wisdom that I've gained from the experience that I'm going through," the incredible singer stated during the conversation with Angie Martinez. "I prayed for a man that loved kids, because, obviously me having my son, if you're gonna love me you've gotta love him. I prayed for a man that was worldly as well. Because I love to explore so someone that was going to teach my world, that was important to me. I was ready to level up."</p><p class=dh>She then implored fans to "be specific" about what they want when they pray.</p><p class=dh>Wilson Russell, who plays as a quarterback for Seattle Seahawks, is currently the highest paid player in NFL history after signing a contract of $140 million with the football team.</p><p class=dh>Ciara and Wilson were rumored to have met in 2015 during the wrap party for the NBC Summer Series, "I can do that."

They later learned that the chemistry between them was mutual.</p><p class=dh>Wilson also <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://atlantablackstar.com/2019/02/27/ciara-fans-applaud-singer-and-husband-russell-wilsons-love-after-he-makes-this-gentlemanly-move/>stated</a> in an interview with "The Rock Church" in San Diego that Ciara had always been the woman of his dreams.</p><p class=dh>"I told somebody that's the girl I want to be with before I even met her," he said, "Before I met her, I was like, I'm probably going to end up with Ciara."</p><p class=dh>Russell also revealed that he and Ciara, as Christians, had taken a vow of celibacy until they were married. Ciara told cosmopolitan in an interview that the period of celibacy was the strongest resistance to temptation because hugs and kisses were involved, but they had to be careful not to go too far.</p><p class=dh>The pair became engaged during a vacation in Seychelles after the quarterback proposed with a 16-carat ring and the couple wasted no time in getting married four months after. The marriage took place at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England. Hundred family and friends were present. Celebrities such as La La Anthony, Kelly Rowland, and Serena Williams, were the singer's bridesmaids. Ciara and Wilson have since had a daughter together, the beauty named Sienna Princess Wilson.</p><p class=dh>The couple was seen together at the Vanity fair Oscars party earlier this year where they looked terrific in Versace outfits. Wilson was seen helping the singer adjust her dress as they took photographs on the red carpet in a video shared by her. The gesture didn't go unnoticed by followers who shared in Ciara's happiness and applauded the Wilson as seen by the comments under the Instagram post.</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Wilson</a> is a hopeless romantic and a loving husband who shows off Ciara on his Instagram and occasionally takes her on fancy date nights. He has also been a loving stepdad to her son despite several feuds with the boy's father, Future, over the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpsamhmZ3qktcCrmGaoopbGpr6MrJ%2BeZaCnrrqxw2aZnp6fp7Juv8eeZKadpGK1b7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./clinton-portis-net-worth-2020-2021.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Clinton Portis Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sally-pressman-is-pregnant-2012610.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Celebrity Moms, Adorable Baby Names and Birth Announcements</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./boots-1960s-footwear-hyph-html.html>___ boots (1960s footwear): Hyph.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-knox-promotes-her-new-memoir-with-a-pr-blitz-do-you-believe-her.html>Amanda Knox promotes her new memoir with a PR blitz: do you believe her?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amy-robach-reveals-fears-10-years-after-breast-cancer-diagnosis-is-avoiding-blood-tests.html>Amy Robach reveals ongoing fears 10 years after breast cancer diagnosis as she admits she is avoidin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-bryniarski-movie-actor-net-worth-270381.html>Andrew Bryniarski Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anne-murray-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Anne Murray Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoSync.
