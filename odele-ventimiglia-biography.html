However, Odele was a mother but it is not known who is the father of her daughter Shiloh.</p><p>We believe that Odele got separated from her partner when she got pregnant because her mother has not stated in her Instagram post anything about Odele’s husband. In the last few months, Odele has not shared any pictures of her sitting with her husband. She celebrated her daughter’s birth with her parents and sister only.
