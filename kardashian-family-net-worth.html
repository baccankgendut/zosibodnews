They remained close friends until his death in 2003 from esophageal cancer.</p><p>Kris married retired Olympic decathlon athlete Bruce Jenner in April 1991, just one month after her divorce from Robert Kardashian became final. Bruce came out as a transgender woman in 2015 and is now Caitlyn Jenner. Kris and Caitlyn have two daughters: Kendall born in 1995 and Kylie, born in 1997.</p><p>The family has been featured on the E! reality television series "Keeping Up with the Kardashians" (and its various spinoffs) since October 2007.

Kardashian went to law school at the University of San Diego. He practiced law for a decade before founding "Radio & Records," a trade publication in 1973. He sold the publication for a considerable profit in 1979. Kardashian also came up with the idea of playing music as filler in movie theaters. The idea proved to be profitable, and he started a company called Movie Tunes based on this premise. Robert Kardashian then connected with his old friend from college, <a href=# title="OJ Simpson Net Worth">OJ Simpson</a>, to start a frozen yogurt company called Juice, Inc. They eventually started a music video production company called Concert Cinema.

Then, in 1994, Simpson allegedly murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman and Simpson turned to his old college friend for representation in the murder trial.

Seacrest had his own production company and sent a cameraman to capture the family in their natural habitat home life. He reviewed the footage and decided to move forward with the project, keeping the popular MTV show "The Osbournes" in mind as an inspiration. From there, "Keeping Up with the Kardashians" was born.

The show highlights the drama that comes with having a blended, celebrity family and many children of similar ages. It also focuses on the business ventures and personal lives of the Kardashian and Jenner kids.
