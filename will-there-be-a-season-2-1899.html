Is Season 2 in the works? Those interested in seeing a series about a group of people making the journey from London to New York City can do so in 1899 on Netflix.</p><p>Emily Beecham’s character, Maura Franklin, set out to find Prometheus in order to locate her brother, whom she thought was on board. Fans are eager to learn more about the show’s future after a shocking discovery about Prometheus was revealed at the end of the series.</p><h2>Is Season 2 of 1899 in the Works?</h2><p>As the show progresses, the audience learns that the ship the protagonists are traveling on is an illusion. Maura’s dad was doing mind experiments on his family because he was convinced that everyone has a unique perspective on the world.</p><p>At the end of the show, Maura found out that the man and boy she had come to see were actually her husband Daniel (Aneurin Barnard) and their son Elliot (Fflyn Edwards).</p><p>In the season finale, it was revealed that Maura and Daniel had developed the simulation to immortalize their sick kid. After waking up, Maura looked out the window and saw that they were in outer space, aboard a starship.</p><p>You can also read about these latest tv shows:</p><p>While working on <a href=# rel=noopener>Project Prometheus</a> in the year 2099, Maura’s brother Ciaran sent her a message reading, “Hello sister, welcome to reality.” The show’s creators, Jantje Friese and Baran bo Odar have teased that a second season is possible, albeit it may be some time before we see it.</p><p>A representative for the show, Jantje, recently discussed their efforts. But she did remark that<a href=# rel=noopener> Netflix</a> ultimately makes the call based on viewership numbers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Is-Season-2-of-1899-in-the-works.jpg><p>The ending, which left some viewers baffled and angry, just begs more questions. In an interview with Making 1899, Lucian actor Jonas Bloquet discussed season two, saying: “Us actors have questions about Season 2 for our characters, too.</p><p>“No, you do season one and then you’ll see,” I was told.</p><p>Aneurin Barnard, who plays Daniel on-screen: “You know you’ve got a hundred questions for Bo before entering a scene when he says, “Well, I haven’t made that choice yet.”</p><p>“Saying something like, “I’m not sure if I want this character to go down that path or that one yet, so let’s see where we take it,” is a common way to express uncertainty about a plot’s future direction.</p><p>“That’s the intriguing part, in that instant you have to make a natural choice of the circumstances and portray the honesty of the moment, regardless of where it’s heading next,” she said.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>1899 debuts at #2 in Netflix’s Weekly Top 10 list of the most-watched English series with almost 80 million hours! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4bZA6Qs6HI</a></p><p>— 1899 🜃 (@1899Netflix) <a href=# rel=noopener>November 22, 2022</a></p><p>As the London shoot wrapped up, Baran bo Odar reflected: “At the conclusion of this shoot, I will undoubtedly go down a hole.” I’m hidden away in a tent with a bunch of monitors, but I really am living the characters’ lives and putting on performances in front of the screens.</p><p>Nobody ever looks there to figure out whether a character is capable of something or not. I’ll miss these characters a lot, but I have hope that we’ll see them again in a future installment.</p><h2>Will there be a Second Season of 1899?</h2><p>The second season of 1899 has not yet been renewed by Netflix. However, there are several possible explanations for this.</p><p>First, the show’s makers are excited to continue production. Co-creator <a href=# rel=noopener>Jantje Friese</a> told in 2021 that they were working hard to have the show last for more seasons, but that ultimately “everything depends on the fans.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Watching 1899 offers viewers a crash course in speaking Cantonese, Spanish, Danish, Polish, German, English, and French. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/v8FiE9YtnS</a></p><p>— Netflix (@netflix) <a href=# rel=noopener>November 22, 2022</a></p><p>Renewals are largely determined by how many people watch an episode, so whether or not 1899 returns for a second season will depend entirely on its popularity with viewers. The show’s trailer has already racked up over eight million views on YouTube, so it’s safe to assume a sizable audience will be turning in.</p><h2>1899 Season 2 Cast</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1899-Season-2-Cast.jpg><h3>Emily Beecham as Maura Franklin</h3><p>English actress and singer Emily Beecham.
